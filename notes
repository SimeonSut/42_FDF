X and Y are the screen vectors

x, y, z are the graph vectors 

Vectors have magnitude and direction, they dont have a position.
Vectors can be seen as the displacement to apply in a x, y, z system to displace one position to another.
Each axis of coordinate is a vector.
Each point is a combination of these 3 vectors

Changing X vector translates the point right/left
Changing Y vector translates the point up/down

Combinations of theses two changes do all other movements

When you think of a location, think of a point and visualize a dot.
When you think of a displacement, think of a vector and visualize an arrow.

Any point can be represented as a Vector from the origin



---VECTOR OPERATIONS---



VECTOR NEGATION
To negate a vectore, negate all components.
The resulting vectore has an oppoosite direction and the same magnitude.


VECTOR MULTIPLICATION
To multiply a vector, multiply all components.
Multiplication, if positive, rescales the vector.
If negative, reverts the vector.
It basically scales the lenght of the vector by the value of the multipicator.


VECTOR DIVISON
To divide a vector, divide all components.


VECTOR ADDITION / SUBSTRACTION
Only between vectors of the same dimension (axis plane ?).


ADDITION
Add all components.
Represented geometrically by putting the tail of b at the head of a. Then draw from tail a to head b.
Commutative -> a + b = b + a


SUBSTRACTION
Add the negation of all components.
Represented geometrically by putting the tail of b at the tail of a. Then draw from head b to head a.
Anticommutative -> a - b = -(b - a)


Geometricaly, it can always be represented by a triangle if only two vectors are represented.

So a 3D vector [1 -3 4] can be represented as the sum of 3 vectors [1 0 0] + [0 -3 0] + [0 0 4].


MAGNITUDE FORMULA
The magnitude of a vector is the square root of the sum of the
squares of the components of the vector.


NORMALIZING A VECTOR (making it the same direction, but with magnitude 1).
Divide the vector by its magnitude.
Makes all vectors of magnitude 1, thus creating a unit circle/sphere.


THE DISTANCE FORMULA
for vector a & vector b & distance d
d = b - a // d is a vector
cf page 77 of 3D Math primer for detailed formula

THE DOT PRODUCT
It is the sum of the products of all corresponding components of two vectors
a . b = ax * bx + ay * by + az * bz
Commutative
